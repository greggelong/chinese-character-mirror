# chinese-character-mirror
captures video and draws character to canvas with its brightness

Chinese character mirror in #p5js . It captures video from camera and draws a Character at a mapped brightness.
I am using three Chinese idioms:
- 破镜重圆  to get back together  
- 镜花水月 to have an unrealistic view of the world 
- 明镜高悬 have a mirror that can tell true from false

I like 镜花水月the best, mirror flower water moon.
